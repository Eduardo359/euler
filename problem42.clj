; The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, tn =
; Â½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:

; 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

; By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its
; alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word
; value. For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 =
; t10. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the
; word a triangle word.

; Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text
; file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are
; triangle words?
